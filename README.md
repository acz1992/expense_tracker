# Expense Tracker

This project was based on MERN stack

## Mission

-   Familiraize myself and practice using the useReducer() and useContext() hooks
-   Create an expense input and tracking component that can be integrated later into a more complex project

## To Do

### Deployment

Messed this up. GitHub pages and OnRender seem to be working, but getting following errors in browser console:
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
GlobalState.js:31 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')
    at getTransactions (GlobalState.js:31:24)

### Styling

Give component a border

### Add login

Add login to secure user information. Or possibly take client section and make part of a bigger project that has authentication
