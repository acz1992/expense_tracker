# Expense Tracker

This project was based on MERN stack

## Mission

-   Familiraize myself and practice using the useReducer() and useContext() hooks
-   Create an expense input and tracking component that can be integrated later into a more complex project

## To Do

### Deployment

Messed this up. Using onrender to host backend, but problem seems to be rendering client part to git pages

### Styling

Give component a border

### Add login

Add login to secure user information. Or possibly take client section and make part of a bigger project that has authentication
